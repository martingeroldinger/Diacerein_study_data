# Diacerein Original study data

research supplement for the submission by Geroldinger et al. in Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases : Statistical recommendations for count, binary, and ordinal data in rare disease cross-over trials. 

In this repository you will find the simulation setup for count and binary outcome as well as the setup for ordinal outcome. In addition, the code for the rare disease analyzer is available, which can also be used for real life data sets and which has already implemented two methods in the first expansion step. This should support the applicability of our results. Further reproducible research supplements for submission can be found also at https://github.com/Lime91/rr-bimj-ordinal , in which we describe the reproducibility of the paper: Geroldinger, et al. (2023). A neutral comparison of statistical methods for analyzing longitudinally measured ordinal outcomes in rare diseases. Biometrical Journal, e2200236. This work provides the background for the recommendations in this current paper.
